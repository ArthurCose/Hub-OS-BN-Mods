Must be required as a Dependency under the 'libraries' section in a mod's package.toml

=== Documentation ===
    A list of commands that this library offers you as a mod creator.

== Creation ==
    ∙ new_barrier(owner, health)
        ∙ Creates a new Barrier-type defense.
        ∙ Health is depleted on every hit.
    ∙ new_aura(owner, health)
        ∙ Creates a new Aura-type defense.
        ∙ Health is fully removed only if damage meets or exceeds health value.
 
== Mechanics & Data ==
    ∙ set_is_aura(is_aura)
        ∙ Determines how health should be handled. Not used externally by default.
        ∙ Allows the user to conditionally switch between Aura and Barrier defense types.
    ∙ is_aura()
        ∙ Returns true if the defense is currently an Aura-type. Otherwise, returns false.
    ∙ set_removal_timer(time)
        ∙ Sets a timer in frames. When the timer expires, so does the defense.
        ∙ Auras commonly use this.
    ∙ set_regeneration_timer(time)
        ∙ Sets a timer, in frames, where the defense will regenerate and become active again after being destroyed by damage.
        ∙ Will automatically enable the timer.
    ∙ set_regeneration_audio(audio)
        ∙ Sets a sound to play when the defense regenerates.
        ∙ If unset, no sound will play.
    ∙ enable_regeneration_timer(is_enabled)
        ∙ Set to true to enable the timer. Set to false to disable and reset the current timer.
    ∙ set_max_health(health_value)
        ∙ Changes the maximum health of the defense. Not used by default.
        ∙ Allows the user to buff or nerf the defense conditionally.
    ∙ get_max_health()
        ∙ Returns the maximum health value of the defense.
    ∙ set_health(health_value)
        ∙ Changes the current health of the defense. Not used by default.
        ∙ Allows the user to conditionally alter the current health of the defense.
    ∙ get_health()
        ∙ Returns the current health value of the defense.
    ∙ set_display_health(boolean)
        ∙ Toggles health display.
        ∙ Auras usually display health. Set to 'true' for this behavior.
    ∙ set_weakness_element(element_list)
        ∙ Sets a {list} of elements that removes the defense when received from an attack.
    ∙ get_weakness_element()
        ∙ Returns the Element that the Defense is weak to, if any.
    ∙ set_hit_flag_weakness(flags)
        ∙ Sets a list of Hit Flags that will automatically remove the defense if present on an attack.
        ∙ Passed as a list: {Hit.Freeze, Hit.Root, Hit.Paralyze} would create a defense that is removed by movement-stopping hit flags.
    ∙ get_hit_flag_weakness()
        ∙ Returns the list set above. Please note that the format is NOT the same as is used in HitProps! Commas, not | pipes.
    ∙ get_defense_rule()
        ∙ Returns the defense rule that is currently in use.
        ∙ Shouldn't be needed for regular usage. Only use if you know what you're doing.
    ∙ get_owner()
        ∙ Returns the entity that the defense is registered to.

== Texture & Animation ==
    ∙ set_texture(path)
        ∙ Sets the sprite to display while active.
        ∙ Use textures returned from Resources.load_texture(path) for better performance
    ∙ get_texture()
        ∙ Returns the texture of the defense's sprite node.
    ∙ get_animation_path()
        ∙ Returns the animation path of the defense's animation
    ∙ set_animation_path(path)
        ∙ Sets the animation file for the sprite.
        ∙ Affix _folder_path for textures loaded into the source mod's folder.
    ∙ set_active_state(state_name)
        ∙ Sets the animation state used while the defense is active.
        ∙ Will be set to use Playback.Loop internally.
    ∙ get_active_state()
        ∙ Returns a string. If the active state is unset, returns nil.
    ∙ set_fade_state(state_name)
        ∙ Sets a custom state that is used if the defense times out.
    ∙ get_fade_state()
        ∙ Returns a string. If the fade state is unset, returns nil.
