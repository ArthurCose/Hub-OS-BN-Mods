description = """
Library for turn based actions within a character mod.

Prevents deleted entities from blocking turn progression.

Supports multiple turn tracking systems:
 - Basic Tracker, cycling between multiple entities
 - Directional Tracker, allows entities with differing facing directions to take turns at the same time
 - Lock, the first ready entity claims control
 - Per Team Lock, similar to lock, allows entities on different teams to take turns at the same time

Inspired by Keristero's turn tracking system for mettaurs
