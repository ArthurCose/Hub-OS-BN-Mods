long_description = """Attempts to recreate the Karma system from BN4. Taking damage will alter a hidden Emotion value.
If your Navi has a Worried state in their emotions animation file, they will display it; otherwise their emotion will still be set to Worried, and they will be tempted with Dark Chips.
This will create two Card Buttons if possible, each containing a Dark Chip from BN4. What you receive IS random, but there are individual weights based on your current health.
Efforts have been made to reduce the chances if a chip was drawn last turn."""
